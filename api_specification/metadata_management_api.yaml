  title: Data Catalogue Metadata API

  description: |
    This API allows you to search, create, update and delete metadata records about data assets published in any data catalogue that implements the [data-catalogue-metadata JSON schema](https://co-cddo.github.io/data-catalogue-metadata/schema).

    This JSON schema is based on the [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/).

    An example of a data catalogue implementing this schema is the [CDDO Data Marketplace](https://datamarketplace.gov.uk).
